Short Summary -
This project on Student Feedback System made to ease the process of students giving feedbacks in various educational institutions. Moreover, the students arenâ€™t able to convey their exact thoughts about the faculty and thereby unable to give proper feedback due to lack of communication skills. This project also considers the rating for faculty, so as to accurately describe the faculty skills, that accounts for genuine feedback. Also, the students can only give one feedback per faculty, that accounts for uniqueness. The students can register themselves using the signup/registration form/page. After that, they become eligible to give feedbacks about the faculties. The faculties can view the feedbacks that are given to them by the students, so as to work according to the same. There is an admin user, that has a complete hold of the entire system. It can perform various functions that are considered as unauthorized for the students and the faculties.
