                   It helps students understand the subject being studied and gives them clear guidance on how to improve their learning.
                   The feedback given must be educative and genuine in nature.
                   <br><br>
                   This is a Student Feedback System where students can give feedback about their courses and faculties.
                   This feedback system asks a bunch of questions so that proper feedback can be given regarding various topics.
                   This project takes feedback from students and provides them to the required faculties so that they know whether they are doing well or they need to do better.
                   Students can also give feedback on the courses undertaken so that the courses can be modified according to the given feedbacks.
                   <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
                   This project on Student Feedback is made by Sanchit Saxena and Aman Srivastava where Frontend and Backend is programmed by Aman Srivastava and the database is designed by Sanchit Saxena.
